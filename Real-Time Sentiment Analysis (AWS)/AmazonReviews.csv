B00000J3VN,2000-09-07#R1SZB6FRQWT56P,51742703,8,"We bought this camera in June and have taken several rolls of fim  since-trying it out for a trip to Ireland in a few days....so far, I like  it a lot.  I do wish the instruction booklet wasn't printed in every  language known to man....it makes it hard to find what you're looking for  fast.  I came to this site today to find what kind of battery to buy-I  swear I couldn't locate that info in the booklet!  (Could just be me,  tho'!)  At any rate, I would recommend this camera-it's so light-just  perfect for travel.",A great little camera!,,4,8,N,N,,,,,,,,

B00004R8V6,2000-09-07#RBAGJL4Y6GRG5,50584198,13,"First off, buy several rechargeable batteries when you get this camera! As  soon as I got mine, we played around with it off-n-on for no more than 3 or  4 hours before the brand-new alkaline batteries were useless. Flashes and  the built-in monitor really suck 'em dry.<br />Now, besides that, the Olympus  D-360L is my first digital camera. Now I'm not really great at taking  pictures, so I put most of the settings on &quot;auto&quot; and hope that I  can Photoshop them into looking better later on. The picture quality is  good overall, but if you want any sort of details captured, you'll have to  use the largest pixel size available, and zoom in, too. So forget about  trying to get those great concert shots from 25 rows back. Most of my work  is on the internet, so it's great for web publishing, but I doubt that  these pics would look that great if they were printed out -- but I haven't  really tried yet, either.<br />The compact design is quite good, so I can't  believe some other reviewer here said that his fell apart after a week. I  know I've carried mine around in my rough-n-tumble book bag for weeks on  end, and it hardly has a scratch on it. If you want to change the camera's  settings, there's a lot of button pushing to change the shutter,  white-balance, and image file size options. My friends have gotten quite  tired of posing and waiting for me to switch around to larger sizes, or to  zoom in, or to take the picture over again because I flashed when I didn't  want to. And there's a slight delay between when I've pushed the button and  when the camera takes the pic. &quot;Capturing the moment&quot; often takes  a couple mintues to prepare. Also, the pictures I've taken often look  fantastic on the LCD monitor, but are fuzzy when I download  them.<br />Downloading is a snap ... sort of. Just install the software once,  then hook the cable up to your serial port and ... wait. It takes several  minutes to download multiple pictures. Heck, it even takes a while just to  view all the thumbnails in the editor. The editing software included is  okay, but it's no Photoshop.<br />The very first weekend I had it, I went to a  crazy drunken club party and took lots of pictures of people dancing around  in an altered haze. Surprisingly, most of the photos came out great -- very  fun and colorful -- except when the flash goes off, people often have red  eye (which is fixable through adjustments) or if they are close to the  camera the flash washed them out like white ghosts. And if I didn't use the  flash, then they came out smeared because the shutter was open too long  since it was compensating for the missing light. It definitely takes some  learned skill to get great shots on the fly.<br />In comparison, though, for  the price you pay here, you are getting a really good deal with this handy  little device. The low-light photos are a bit grainy but quite bright  considering a normal camera would show the same situation as nothing but  black. I haven't yet figured out how to get it to take pictures so that it  looks darkly lit on purpose; it always seems to automatically compensate.  Also, the multi-photo &quot;panoramic&quot; option and the &quot;action  sequence&quot; modes are fun to play with, but not necessarily going to be  useful to me in the long run. On one 8mb card, you can fit about 16 big  files, but tons of little photos. And remember, rechargeables,  rechargeables, rechargeables!","Good pictures, Good size, Great memory, Battery hog!",,4,13,N,N,,,,,,,,

I thought it would be a good  opportunity to get a nice little camera that was convenient to try the new  Advantix film format.  I have enjoyed both.  The camera is light, of a nice  size, good zoom range, and very versatile in respect to the price.   Naturally it is not the best camera on the market, but for the price it  can't be beat.  The only annoyances I have found is that it automatically  defaults back to the 4x7 picture size so you have to remember to change it  - also the auto shut-off feature designed to save battery power, all to  often I have gone to take a picture and the camera has turned itself off  because I left it on for too long.  Still, for the price, nothing beats the  ease and convenience of this little gem of a camera.",Great Camera,,5,15,N,N,,,,,,,,

B00004SYN1,2000-09-06#R2MPGG6R50NKEN,52603833,36,"1. Turn the LCD screen off except when framing shots.  This will allow the  battery to last a long time.  2. Make sure that you have the most recent  operating system for the camera.  It should be v.1.0.0.2.  You can verify  this (via any of the included software programs) when the camera is  connected to your computer.  This firmeware upgrade corrects many of the  color imbalances as well as allowing a faster shutter speed for flash  pictures (1/30th sec. vs. 1/15th), which reduces the probability of camera  shake. 3. Don't try and install the firmware upgrade (available on the  Canon website) if you have a Mac.  I don't know the genesis of the problem  (something about the USB connection or an installation glitch) but for most  people the camera freezes during upgrade, rendering it useless.  Canon can  install this for you under warranty and are very quick on turnaround.  (I  guess this is a long winded way of saying - give it a shot, but only if  you're prepared to send it to Canon anyway).<br />I'd give it 5 stars, but the  glitch I had with the firmware upgrade irked me.  Canon did fix it promptly  and the camera works like a charm.",Some tips when using this camera,,4,39,N,N,,,,,,,,

But the ability to set &quot;profiles&quot; for different  users (focus settings saved for different preferences) makes this a truly  useful camera.  A novice's best friend, the quick focus and easy dials and  readings turn out terrific pictures without any hardship.  If you are more  experienced, the many options for manual photography are equal to or  surpass most other cameras in this price range.  The eye-directed focus  feature is intriguing and kind of cool, though not what you would use all  the time.  This kit ships with a 28-80mm lens, great for &quot;all  around&quot; photography.

B00004THDE,2000-09-07#R11KACPP85PGCA,53096135,137,"The problem with high power binoculars is that humans can't hold them  steady, and that jitter makes it impossible to really look at something  without a tripod.  The image stabilization in this pair solves that problem  and holds things rock steady.  This is an expensive product that clearly  distingues itself, and one of those products that technology makes seem a  little magic.<br /> I have only two small complaints: First, for a product  this expensive they should pre-install the neck strap for you -- not a big  deal, but it would be nice for the customer.  Second, I wish the lens cap  covers were higher quality and attachable to the unit so they wouldn't get  lost.

We stood at the window of our 24th floor office and read the menu of a hot-dog cart on a corner a block and a half away.<br />What really clinches it (and made it possible to read the hot-dog cart menu) is the image stabilization. If you have a high magnification, any minor shake of your hand is magnified.  Try it with a video camera with one of thos high digital zooms.  When you're at 100x, even the electronic image stabilization can't compensate just for the average minor muscle twitches in your hand. <br />The image stabilization on this is optical (i.e. analog), not digital, meaning there's no fuzzing of the image as a processor tries to adjust the image to compensate for vibration. Optical zoom and optical stabilization require more expensive mechanical components to implement, thus you'll see mid-range video cameras offering their digital counterparts to enhance or substitute for optical zooms and stabilizers.  <br />Given, these binoculars will set you back a pretty penny, but you could go to a ball game, sit in the nosebleeds and count the laces on the ball. Definitely a very cool thing for the gadget-oriented.",Almost a hand-held telescope,,5,31,N,N,,,,,,,,
